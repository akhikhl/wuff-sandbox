This is the simplest example of Wuff-driven feature.

Notes:

1. Feature generation is enabled by applying plugin 'org.akhikhl.wuff.eclipse-feature'.

2. 'java' and 'groovy' plugins are neither required nor prohibited.

3. The feature automatically includes bundles from special configuration 'feature' (see dependencies section).

4. 'feature' configuration is not transitive. That means: Wuff will include exactly those bundles you mentioned, without their dependencies. You can enable transitive dependencies by code:
  ```
  configurations.feature.transitive = true
  ```
  
5. The feature is generated by invoking `gradle build`. 

6. The generated feature is located in directory `"${buildDir}/feature-output"`.

7. By default feature gets the same name and version, as gradle project. This can be changed (see further examples).
